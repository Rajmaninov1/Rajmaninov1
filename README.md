# PRINCIPAL PROJECTS

- Automated Email Processing with AWS: I developed a serverless solution that validates, categorizes, and routes Outlook emails using Lambda. Valid emails are sent to specific systems (internal and third party integrations), while invalid ones trigger notifications and are moved to error folders. I used SQS for message processing and integrated EventBridge, API Gateway, and Secrets Manager for scalability and security.

- Scalable Notification System: I designed and implemented a notification system using SQS, SNS, SES, and Lambda to process events from a FastAPI API, automating the generation of dynamic, scalable emails.

- Authentication Migration to AWS Cognito: I led the migration of a custom authentication system to Cognito, integrating OAuth2 and Secrets Manager to enhance security, simplify user management, and ensure scalability.

- Developed three microservices using FastAPI, HTTPX, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Docker: one for scraping data from Google Maps and landing pages, another for LinkedIn scraping, and a third for automating interactions on WhatsApp Web. The microservices were containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS ECS and Fargate.

- Developed the backend for a content management system (CMS) using Wagtail for a teachers' website created for an educational books publisher. The project provided teachers with access to resources like lesson plans, guides, and assessments organized by grade levels and subjects. I implemented custom features such as user management and role-specific profiles for teachers and administrators

- Developed a comprehensive internal website as a full-stack developer using Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, collaborating across all departments. The platform includes a news portal with category filters, an employee directory, a training site for managing courses with permissions, data charts and tables showing financial performance, NPS, and customer satisfaction metrics, along with a Google Forms clone. I handled everything from database design, SQL procedures, data cleaning, backend and frontend development, to deployment. Memcached was used for caching to optimize performance, providing the company with a scalable and user-friendly solution.
